## Description


SOLAR is an immersive app on Microsoft HoloLens that allows users to zoom in to a customizable level, hear written text (e.g. books, newspapers, documents, TV) as spoken speech, and recognize other people nearby (giving names for stored people, and age/gender/emotion estimates for others). 

SOLAR utilizes Unity, implementing various services from Microsoft’s Azure Cognitive Services.

## Real World Application

Millions of people with age suffer from moderate to severe health degradation, including but not limited to vision impairment, eye disease, Alzheimer's, and other various forms of challenges to daily life. SOLAR aims to bring light to these struggles and empower people with these conditions to live with greater ease.

## How it was Made

Platform: Microsoft Hololens / Universal Windows Platform Development Tools: Microsoft Visual Studio 2017, Unity, Github SDKs: Windows SDK APIs: Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services, Mixed Reality Toolkit. Assets: None

## Challenges/Setbacks




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Learning Experience
- Completely different hands on experience with AR along with Unity development. 
- Shift from familiar languages, new exposure to programming in C# compared to C++ and C. 
- Lots of initial planning issues with both either the Magic Leap we have or the Hololens running older versions of software that current tools we’re looking at are incompatible(Purchased models of AR are older)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## What's next for S.O.L.A.R

- Speech-to-text conversion intergration with the AR, aiding people with hearing disabilities to be able to read what other people are saying
